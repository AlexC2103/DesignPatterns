/**
 * Bridge Design Pattern
 *
 * Intent: Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into
 * two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be
 * developed independently of each other.
 *
 * Example: In this example, the Page hierarchy acts as the Abstraction, and the
 * Renderer hierarchy acts as the Implementation. Objects of the Page class can
 * assemble web pages of a particular kind using basic elements provided by a
 * Renderer object attached to that page. Since both of the class hierarchies
 * are separate, you can add a new Renderer class without changing any of the
 * Page classes and vice versa.
